### **Reset for Programming Teams**  

**Tagline:** *Start fresh, stay focused, and ship fast.*  

---

### **Core Concept:**  
A minimalist, Kanban-style project management tool designed for teams of 2–5 developers. The goal is to make task management frictionless and encourage iterative progress by emphasizing regular "reset moments" for sprint planning and retrospectives.

---

### **Key Features:**  

#### **1. Fresh Start Sprints**  
- **Reset Sessions:** At the start of each sprint, the app clears the current board and prompts the team to re-prioritize tasks.  
- **Sprint Focus Zones:** Set up weekly or bi-weekly goals with a maximum of 10 tasks in focus at any time, preventing overwhelm.  
- **Personalized Boards:** Each member gets their own focus lane alongside the shared team board.  

#### **2. Lightweight Kanban Board**  
- **Customizable Lanes:** Default setup includes "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," and "Done," but easily adjustable.  
- **Dependencies Visualization:** Mark tasks as dependent on others and visualize the relationships.  
- **Compact Team Mentions:** Tag teammates for task updates, code reviews, or collaboration.  

#### **3. Integrated Developer Tools**  
- **Code Repo Integration:** Connect with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to automatically pull issues or link pull requests.  
- **Inline Snippets:** Attach code snippets or markdown notes directly to tasks for easy context sharing.  
- **Build Alerts:** Get notifications for CI/CD pipeline statuses tied to specific tasks.  

#### **4. Reflection and Iteration**  
- **Retro Board:** A separate area for collecting notes on what went well, what didn’t, and action items for improvement.  
- **Progress Snapshots:** Automatically save and compare task states at the beginning and end of each sprint.  

#### **5. Minimal Overhead**  
- **Quick Task Creation:** Add tasks using a command-line style input (`@user - Fix API bug [2h]`).  
- **Simple Permissions:** All members have equal access to tasks and features, avoiding complex role hierarchies.  
- **Offline Sync:** Lightweight offline mode with automatic syncing when back online.

### **Design Philosophy:**  
- **Clean UI:** Minimalist and distraction-free, prioritizing task clarity and flow.  
- **Collaboration-First:** Every feature encourages discussion and alignment among team members.  
- **Iterative Improvements:** The app evolves based on frequent user feedback, in line with its own philosophy of starting fresh.  

---

### **Potential Extras:**  
- **AI-Powered Task Estimation:** Suggests effort levels and durations for new tasks.  
- **"Reset Mondays":** Optional reminders to kick off the week with fresh goals.  
- **Burnout Tracker:** Simple visual indicators showing when tasks or workloads might be unevenly distributed.
